# Online_Portfolio

-A side project that acts somewhat like a website version of my resume. Used SCSS for web page design, Node.js for back-end and Express library for handling routes.

-Used Visual Studio Code for this project with extensions: Prettier, Live Server and WSL(To use Ubuntu Terminal instead of Powershell inside the Visual Studio Code application)

-Initial purpose of the project was to learn HTML and CSS along with Javascript and Node.js.
